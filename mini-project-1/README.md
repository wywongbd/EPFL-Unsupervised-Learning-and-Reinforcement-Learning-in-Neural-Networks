# Mini Project 1 - Kohonen Networks and Hebbian Learning on handwritten digits

This is based on an assignment of the CS-434 course taught at EPFL. The goal is to implement a Kohonen Self Organizing Map to visualize high dimensional vectors (from images) in a 2-dimensional map. The Kohonen Map was further modified to perform supervised classification.
